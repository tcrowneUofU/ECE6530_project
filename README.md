####### LAB P4 FILE LIST #######
./lab_P4_README.txt   - Readme file
./main.m              - Main Lab P4 script, see section X for information on how to run
./beat.m              - Helper function for generating beat waveforms
./mychirp.m           - Helper function for generating chirp waveforms
./html/Lab_P4.html    - Published HTML file containing MATLAB script from Lab_P4.m and generated figures
./html/Lab_P4_0x.html - Published figures for use in Lab_P4.html generated by Lab_P4.m

####### RUN INSTRUCTIONS #######
1. Unzip Lab_P4.zip
2. Add the resulting output directory to the MATLAB path. This can be
   done with the Home Tab > Environment > Set Path
3. Type the command "main" into the MATLAB command window


## P-7: FM Synthesis for Musical Instruments
### Braden Brown, Kevin Duplisea

Questions 4.1-4.4.
This will go over each file's purpose and operation.

bellenv.m

There is no user input required for this code.  This is a peice of
MATLAB code that generates a decay function for use in the bell.m
function. This is done by using an exponential decay function.  This
code is a helper file for other code. Examine it if further insight is
needed on how the envelope is generated.


bell.m

There is no user input required for this code.  This is a peice of
MATLAB code that generates a bell function.  This is done by
modulating a cosine function with another cosine function.  This code
generates the full bell sound envelope.  While function does not
create the sound itself, it can however be called and used in other
code to generate the sound.  Examine it if further insight is needed
on how the bell sound is generated.


## S-7: Spectrograms of AM and FM Signals
### Derek Anderson

The S7 section of the lab is about the analysis of AM and FM signals
using spectrograms. All of the project code is found in the S7/S7.m
file, which depends on the dsp first toolbox for spectrogram plotting
functionality. The zip for this toolbox is included in the repository,
and the instructions for its use are below:

1. Unzip spfirst_vNNN.zip
2. Add the resulting output directory to the MATLAB path. This can be
   done with the Home Tab > Environment > Set Path
3. Type the command "spfirst" into the MATLAB command window. This adds other directories to the matlab path.

Now S7.m can be run as normal as a matlab script and the dependent
functions should be resolved from the MATLAB path.
